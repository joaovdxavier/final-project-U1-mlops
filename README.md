# Final Project for Unit 1 of MLOps Subject at UFRN
Hi! This repository contains the code, files and other things I used to complete the challenge proposed by professor Ivanovitch Silva for Unit 1. The things I used are better explained in this [loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/6671e8a73e2c4647addf58f859c1d334). Feel free to contact me with any suggestions.

If you wanna run the project, get into the main folder and type:

``` streamlit run project.py ```

If you want to check pylint's evalution, type:

``` pylint project.py ```

If any dependency error is thrown, try to install these dependencies:

```
pip install streamlit
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install pylint
pip install logging
```
